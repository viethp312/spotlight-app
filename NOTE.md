# ScrollView vs FlatList

## Use FlatList when:

- **Performance is critical**: FlatList only renders items currently visible on screen, saving memory and improving performance.
- **Long Lists of data**: When rendering potentially large sets of data (feeds, search results, message lists).
- **Unknown content length**: When you don't know in advance how many items you'll need to display.
- **Same kind of content**: When displaying many items with the same structure.

## Use ScrollView when:

- **All content fits in memory**: When you're displaying a small, fixed amount of content that won't cause performance issues.
- **Static content**: For screens with predetermined, limited content like forms, profile pages, or detail views.
- **Mixed content types**: When you need to display different UI components in a specific layout that doesn't follow a list pattern.
- **Horizontal carousel-like elements**: Small horizontal scrolling components like image carousels with limited items.

# Pressable vs TouchableOpacity

## Use Pressable when:

- **More customization is needed**: Pressable offers more customization options for different states (pressed, hovered, focused).
- **Complex interaction states**: When you need to handle multiple interaction states with fine-grained control.
- **Future-proofing**: Pressable is newer and designed to eventually replace the Touchable components.
- **Platform-specific behavior**: When you want to customize behavior across different platforms.
- **Nested press handlers**: When you need to handle nested interactive elements.

## Use TouchableOpacity when:

- **Simple fade effect**: When you just need a simple opacity change on press.
- **Backwards compatibility**: When working with older codebases that already use TouchableOpacity.
- **Simpler API**: When you prefer a more straightforward API with fewer options to configure.
- **Specific opacity animations**: When you need precise control over the opacity value on press.
- **Legacy support**: For maintaining consistency with existing components.

# Expo Image vs React Native Image

## Use Expo Image when:

- **Performance**: Expo Image uses native image libraries that can offer better performance.
- **Caching**: Built-in caching system is more robust and configurable.
- **Modern image capabilities**: Need for advanced features like content-aware resizing, blurhash placeholders, and progressive loading.
- **Transitions**: When you need smooth transitions between image loading states.
- **Cross-platform consistency**: More consistent behavior across iOS and Android.
- **Adaptivity**: Better support for adaptive images based on screen size and resolution.

## Use React Native Image when:

- **Simplicity**: When you need basic image display with minimal configuration.
- **Bundle size**: When you're trying to keep your app's bundle size smaller.
- **No Expo dependency**: When you're not using Expo or want to minimize dependencies.
- **Legacy support**: When maintaining compatibility with existing code that uses React Native Image.
- **Basic requirements**: When advanced image features aren’t needed for your use case.

# **icon.png vs adaptive-icon.png**

## icon.png

- This is the standard app icon that appears on most devices. It's the primary icon for your app.
- Recommended img size: 1024x1024

## adaptive-icon.png

- Introduced in Android 8.0 (Oreo), this is specific to Android devices.
- Recommended img size: 1024x1024

**If you don't provide these icons, your app will still work, but it will use Expo's default icons. For a professional app that you plan to publish to the App Store or Play Store, you should definitely include your own custom icons.**

# React Native Gesture Handler

- Gestures are a great way to provide an intuitive user experience in an app.
- The **React Native Gesture Handler** library provides built-in native components that can handle gestures.
  - It recognizes pan, tap, rotation, and other gestures using the platform's native touch handling system.
